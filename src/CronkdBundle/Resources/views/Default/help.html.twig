            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="{{ path('fos_user_registration_register') }}" class="navbar-link">Create a free user account</a> by registering with your email address and password.</li>
                <li>Create your kingdom.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Manage a single <strong>kingdom</strong> in a <strong>world</strong> of kingdoms created by other users like yourself.</li>
                <li>View other kingdoms' <i class="fa fa-tint"></i> <strong>Liquidity</strong> and <i class="fa fa-line-chart"></i> <strong>Net Worth</strong> to determine kingdom strength and vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Diligence, strategy, and political savvy will help you become the strongest kingdom in the world!</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Kingdoms have <strong>resources</strong> like Civilians, Material, Housing, Military, and more.</li>
                <li style="list-style: none;">
                    <ul>
                        <li>One Civilian produces one Material over 8 Ticks</li>
                        <li>One Civilian and one Material builds one Housing over 8 Ticks</li>
                        <li>One Civilian can be trained into one Military over 8 Ticks</li>
                        <li>One Military can be trained into one Hacker over 8 Ticks</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Resources will be dispersed evenly over time.  For example, producing 8 Material will disperse 1 Civilian and 1 Material every Tick for 8 Ticks.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Hacking Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hack</strong> other kingdoms for information about their Military and other resources.</li>
                <li>The more Hackers you assign to hack another kingdom, the more likely it is your hack attempt will succeed.</li>
                <li>Hackers you send on a hacking attempt will be available again in one Tick.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Attacking other Kingdoms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Attack</strong> kingdoms successfully to steal their resources and accelerate your growth.</li>
                <li>Build a strong <strong>Military</strong> so that you may defeat other kingdoms' defending army on the battlefield.  If you send more Military in your attack, you will be the victor.</li>
                <li>If you win an attack, you will be awarded with 20% of your opponent's available Civilians and 50% of their available Material.</li>
                <li>You may only attack once per Tick, so make it count!</li>
            </ul>
